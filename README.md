# PlayQ: Game Library and list making platform

I worked on a personal project to learn React, Next.js, and React Server Components. The app allows users to query a expanding database of top games, make lists, and share them with friends. Throughout the project, I gained knowledge of working with Server Components, combining data with UI, utilising Prisma for complex queries, and implementing Radix UI elements inspired by the Shad/cn library.
